# SIEM-Home-Lab-for-Log-Analysis-Threat-Detection-and-Incident-Response
Built a practical SIEM home lab simulating SOC operations. Implemented file integrity monitoring, brute-force attack detection, vulnerability analysis, and automated threat response. Gained hands-on experience in real-time log analysis, rule configuration, and incident response to strengthen defensive security skills.
